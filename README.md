## ðŸŒŸ Goals of this project
* Work in a group environment on an application while performing all the steps associated with the object-oriented software development life cycle.
* Write technical high-level design and detailed design of a software system.
* Create an effective and secure application.
* Prepare and successfully give an oral presentation of a software system design and operation of the class project deliverables.

## ðŸ”¨ Development
Pantry Pal is originally developed for the Spring 2021 semester of UCF's COP 4331 course, Process of Object Oriented Software, taught by Dr. Rick Leinecker.

### Technologies:
* MongoDB, Express, Flutter, Node
* Figma, GitHub, Google Sign-In, Android Studio, VS Code
* Discord, Zoom, Doodle Poll

### What went well:
*   Project idea was decided early on, giving us a head start on development.
* Using Flutter allowed us to build the mobile app and web app at the same time, making the two more cohesive and gave a time advantage.
* Meeting twice a week helped keep everyone on the same page.

### What did not go well
* Better communication early on wouldâ€™ve helped us accomplish goals sooner.
* Using MongoDB instead of Firebase made backend development a bit more difficult.
